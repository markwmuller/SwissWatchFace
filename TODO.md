# TODO

* Check on fenix 5 (border on edge?)
* Test European daylight savings time bug?
  * Wirklich sch√∂ne Replikation. ich nur das Problem, dass noch immer Sommerzeit angezeigt wird. Ja nur bei dieser WF  
* I wanted to let you know that the watchface started struggling with displaying a second hand correctly. I chose to have a second hand always displayed in options. But now and again it stops on different positions in a dial not showing correct reading. It catches up after a while. I would appreciate if you had a look on this issue. Maybe there is an easy fix?
