Swiss Railway Watch

#  Description (Maximum 4,000 Characters)

An analog watch that is in the style of the clocks you'll find at Swiss Railway stations (SBB/CFF/FFS). 

In the settings, you can emulate a synchronization pulse, where the second hand runs a little fast, and then pauses at the 59 second mark before the minutes advance (emulating a central accurate clock sending a synchronization pulse). 

You can also invert black / white colors for a darker watch face. Toggle anti-aliasing in the settings; might use less power with anti-aliasing "off", but won't look as nice. 

There is currently no display of notifications, battery, etc.

#  Whatâ€™s New (Optional) (Maximum 4,000 Characters)
V0.1 -- Added Anti-aliasing, which will give a much nicer display. This only works on newer watches, I think. 
	  - Removed option to disable power-saving seconds hiding, this was causing some issues. 
	  - Added option to show date, but this only works if anti-aliasing is set to "true"
