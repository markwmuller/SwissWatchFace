Swiss Railway Watch

#  Description (Maximum 4,000 Characters)

An analog watch that is in the style of the clocks you'll find at Swiss Railway stations (SBB/CFF/FFS). 

In the settings, you can emulate a synchronization pulse, where the second hand runs a little fast, and then pauses at 59s before the minutes advance (emulating a central accurate clock sending a synchronization pulse). 

You can also invert black / white colors, and there's a power saver that hides the second hand. 

There is currently no display of date, notifications, steps, etc.
