# Title

Swiss Railway Watch

#  Description (Maximum 4,000 Characters)

An open source analog watch that is in the style of the clocks you'll find at Swiss Railway stations (SBB/CFF/FFS). 

In the settings, you can emulate a synchronization pulse, where the second hand runs a little fast, and then pauses at the 59 second mark before the minutes advance (emulating a central accurate clock sending a synchronization pulse). 

A warning will show if battery drops below 30%, turning red for less than 20% (you can disable the icon you prefer). It'll also show you a notification icon (can also be disabled).

The date is printed, but that can be disabled too. 

You can also invert black / white colors for a darker watch face. 

Note that Garmin's "low power mode" kicks in after about 10sec, and then the watch face will become a little uglier (anti-aliasing will be turned off), but the seconds can still be shown continuously. There is a second to subsequently hide the seconds, which should save some power.

V0.2.2

V0.2.1
* Added support for Venu & FR945. Note, for Venu, battery draw is likely atrocious unless you do "invert colors"

* Added a low battery warning, kicks in at below 30% battery level.
* Open-sourced code at https://github.com/markwmuller/SwissWatchFace/
V0.1
* Added Anti-aliasing, which will give a much nicer display. This only works on newer watches, I think. 
* Removed option to disable power-saving seconds hiding, this was causing some issues. 
* Added option to show date, but this only works if anti-aliasing is set to "true"
