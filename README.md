# Title

Swiss Railway Watch

#  Description (Maximum 4,000 Characters)

An open source analog watch that is in the style of the clocks you'll find at Swiss Railway stations (SBB/CFF/FFS). 

In the settings, you can emulate a synchronization pulse, where the second hand runs a little fast, and then pauses at the 59 second mark before the minutes advance (emulating a central accurate clock sending a synchronization pulse). 

A warning will show if battery drops below 30% (you can disable this if you prefer). 

The date is printed, but that can be disabled too. 

You can also invert black / white colors for a darker watch face. 



#  Whatâ€™s New (Optional) (Maximum 4,000 Characters)
**V0.2** 
* Now only works with devices having anti-aliasing; removed all the code clutter from the non-anti-aliased options.
* Added a low battery warning, kicks in at below 30% battery level.
* Open-sourced code at https://github.com/markwmuller/SwissWatchFace/

**V0.1**
* Added Anti-aliasing, which will give a much nicer display. This only works on newer watches, I think. 
* Removed option to disable power-saving seconds hiding, this was causing some issues. 
* Added option to show date, but this only works if anti-aliasing is set to "true"
